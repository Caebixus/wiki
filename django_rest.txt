Serializers
#Serializers in Django REST Framework are responsible for converting objects into data types understandable by javascript and front-end frameworks. Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first validating the incoming data.
--> serializers are helpful to manipulate JSON data. When we are returning data to our APIs and also for validating data.
